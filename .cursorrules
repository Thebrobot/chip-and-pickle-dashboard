Build a Next.js App Router dashboard webapp.

Use TypeScript and Tailwind.

Use a sidebar layout for authenticated routes.

All routes under /dashboard require login.

Prefer simple, readable components.

Do not invent data models; ask or propose defaults for tasks/budgets/projects.

(These rules apply to Chat + Cmd/K style generation.)
